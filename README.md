## bootmessage.nut 2.2.0 ##

Incorporates code which logs impOS and network information. It is intended to be included early in the runtime (hence the name). Includes functions and code to trigger those functions. Compatible with **seriallog.nut**.

#### Public Methods ####

- *message()* &mdash; Display the boot info to the log
- *version()* &mdash; Return the current impOS&trade; version, eg. `"38.5"`

  - Bug fixes
- 1.1.0
  - Support `seriallog.nut`

## disconnect.nut 2.0.1 ##

Provides *disconnectionManager*, a gloabl object which operates as a handler for imp connection states. Call *disconnectionManager.start()* to begin monitoring and to allow the imp automatically to attempt to reconnect when it disconnects unexpectedly. *disconnectionManager.connect()* and *disconnectionManager.disconnect()* can then be used to, respectively, connect to and disconnect from the server, and should be used in place of the imp API methods *server.connect()* and *server.disconnect()*.

The properties *disconnectionManager.reconnectTimeout* and *disconnectionManager.reconnectDelay* can be used to set, respectively, the period after which a disconnected imp will attempt to reconnect, and the timeout period it allows for the reconnection attempt. These values default to, respectively, 60 and 30 seconds.

The property *disconnectionManager.eventCallback* can be set to a function with a single parameter, *event*. This function will then be called whenever a connection is made, the imp disconnects, or the imp attempts to connect. The value of *event* is a table:

| Key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| *type* | The impâ€™s state, one of:<br />`"connected"`,<br />`"disconnected"`,<br /> `"connecting"` |
| *message* | A human-readable status message |

#### Public Properties ####

- *reconnectTimeout* &mdash; Connection attempt timeout. Integer. Default: 30
- *reconnectDelay* &mdash; Delay between connection attempts. Integer. Default: 60
- *isConnected* &mdash; Whether the device is currently connected or not. Boolean
- *eventCallback* &mdash; A function to be called when the device's state changes. Should take the form 'function(event)', where 'event' is a table with the key 'message', whose value is a human-readable string, and 'type' is a machine readable string, eg. 'connected'. Default: `null`

#### Public Methods ####

- *start()* &mdash; Begin monitoring device connection. Parameters:
  - *timeout* &mdash; See imp API's **server.setsendtimeoutpolicy()**. Integer. Default: 10 
  - *sendPolicy* &mdash; See imp API's **server.setsendtimeoutpolicy()**. Integer. Default: *WAIT_TIL_SENT*
- *stop()* &mdash; Stop monitoring device connection
- *connect()* &mdash; Manually attempt to connect to the server
- *disconnect()* &mdash; Manually disconnect from the server
- *setCallback()* &mdash; Set the event callback (see above). Parameters:
  - *callback* &mdash; A function to be called when the device's state changes. Should take the form 'function(event)', where 'event' is a table with the key 'message', whose value is a human-readable string, and 'type' is a machine readable string, eg. 'connected'. Default: `null`

#### Release Notes ####

- 2.0.1
  - Add reason code to back-online messaging
- 2.0.0
  - Add 'sendPolicy' parameter to *start()* (default: *WAIT_TIL_SENT*)
  - Set state when *start()* called
  - Deal with impOS <= 38 issue with ounexpecteddisconnect() being called twice when IP address lost (ie. WiFi up but router link lost)
  - Add support for *utilities* *(see above)* to set time string correctly
- 1.0.2
  - Add 'timeout' parameter to *start()* (default: 10s)
  - Add version number to file
- 1.0.1
  - Change order of re-connect message: off-time then on-time
- 1.0.0
  - Initial release

## seriallog.nut 2.0.2 ##

Incorporates code which sends log and error messages to UART as well as to *server.log()* and *server.error()*. To use this code as-is, replace all your *server.log()* and *server.error()* calls with *seriallog.log()* and *seriallog.error()*. The code creates the object *seriallog* as a global variable. you can therefore check for the presence of the object using `if ("seriallog" in getroottable()) { ... }`.

The code does not now call *configure()* immediately, to allow you to so do first. If you do not, *configure()* will be called the first time you attempt to send a log message.

The default UART depends on the the type of imp on which the code is running:

| imp | Default UART |
| --- | --- |
| imp001 | hardware.uart12 |
| imp002 | hardware.uart12 |
| imp003 | hardware.uartDM |
| imp004m | hardware.uartHJ |
| imp005 | hardware.uart0 |

Logging to UART can be controlled by calling *seriallog.enable()* or *seriallog.disable()*, or setting the *seriallog.enabled* property directly. This does not affect logging via the server, which will always be used, provided there is a connection to the server.

#### Public Properties ####

- *enabled* &mdash; Whether the serial output is enabled. Boolean

#### Public Methods ####

- *configure()* &mdash; Set up the serial link. Should always be called by host app. Parameters:
  - *uart* &mdash; See imp API's **server.setsendtimeoutpolicy()**. Integer. Default: depends on device imp type 
  - *baudrate* &mdash; The UART speed. Integer. Default: 115200
  - *txsize* &mdash; The size of the UART TX buffer. Integer. Default: 160 characters
  - *enable* &mdash; Whether to enable serial logging. Boolean. Default: `true`
- *enable()* &mdash; Enable serial logging
- *disable()* &mdash; Disable serial logging
- *log()* &mdash; Log a non-error message to serial (if enabled) and the server
- *error()* &mdash; Log an error message to serial (if enabled) and the server
